# Future Sales Prediction (Jupyter Notebook Project)

This project is a beginner-friendly **Future Sales Prediction System** built entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**. The goal is to extract sales data from an external **API**, load it into a **PostgreSQL** database, clean and transform it using a simple **ELT process**, and then train a basic machine-learning model to predict future sales.

## Project Steps

### 1. Extract Data
- Connect to an API and download raw sales data.
- Inspect and save the raw data inside the notebook.

### 2. Load Data into PostgreSQL
- Insert the API data into a PostgreSQL table for storage and organization.

### 3. Transform & Clean Data (ELT)
- Fix missing or incorrect attributes.
- Convert dates into the correct format.
- Remove duplicates and prepare the dataset for analysis.

### 4. Analyze the Data
- Explore trends, patterns, and missing values.
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.

### 5. Train a Machine Learning Model
- Use a simple model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest).
- Train it on the cleaned data to learn historical sales patterns.

### 6. Predict Future Sales
- Generate future sales predictions based on the trained model.
- Display the predictions in the notebook.

## Summary
This project teaches beginners how to perform the full data workflow:
**Extract → Load → Transform → Analyze → Train → Predict**  
using Python, Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL, and basic machine learning techniques.
